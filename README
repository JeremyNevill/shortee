# Shortee - Shorthand for the web

*Shortee* is a syntax for logging things that you have done, and things that you want to do.  

The design aims are: 

* Shortee syntax should be human readable
* Shortee syntax should be computer parseable
* Shortee syntax should be easily memorised 
* Shortee messages (shorts) should be concise enough to work in as many systems as possible, e.g. email, sms, twitter, postitnotes

## An Example

The simplest way to log something is the aim.. for example, to record that you have driven 200 miles on New Year's day 2011:

    @j3r3m7 drove 100 miles 01/jan/2011

Or if you have just paid your car tax:

    @j3r3m7 paidcartax 249 ukp 03/sep/2010
