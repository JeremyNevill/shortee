# Shortee - Shorthand for the web

*Shortee* is a syntax for logging things that you have done, and thinks that you want to do.  

The simplest way to log something is the aim.. for example, to record that you have driven 200 miles for business you could write:

@j3r3m7 drove 100 miles 01/jan/2011

Or if you have just paid your car tax:

@j3r3m7 paidcartax 249 UKP 03/sep/2010
